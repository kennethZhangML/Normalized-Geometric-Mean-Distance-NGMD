Normalized Geometric Mean Distance (NGMD) - Unique Clustering Metric

The NGMD metric provides a measure of the quality of clustering by calculating the geometric mean of the pairwise distances between the centroids of the clusters, 
normalized by the distance between the two farthest points in the dataset. This metric is useful in determining 
how well the clustering algorithm has grouped similar data points together while keeping the clusters well separated from each other. 
A lower NGMD value indicates that the clustering algorithm has produced a better clustering solution. 
Therefore, NGMD can be an important tool in evaluating clustering algorithms and comparing different clustering solutions.
